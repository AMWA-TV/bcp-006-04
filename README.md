This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Enables Registration, Discovery, and Connection Management of MPEG TS Endpoints using the AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 NMOS Specifications.

### Why does it matter?

- It creates a set of requirements for interoperable implementations offering the Discovery and Connection Management of MPEG TS endpoints.

### How does it work?

- It specifies what resources and attributes MUST be provided when using NMOS with MPEG TS streams.
- MPEG TS streams are considered as mux format, and this specification does not consider streams within the multiplex.
- It provides examples of how to use IS-04 and IS-05 in the context of MPEG TS streams with RTP transport, such as VSF TR-01 and VSF TR-07
